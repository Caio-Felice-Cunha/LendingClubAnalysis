## Business Problem
> Data source: https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema. Data source for quotation: https://finance.yahoo.com/

LendingClub is a financial services company. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.<br>
The first problem that will be solved is the one involving the dataset that needs several adjustments.<br>
So the main problem to be solved at this moment is to clean and pre-process the data.<br>
Note: We used the dataset available at the link above as a source of data, but we made changes to the data to make it even more problematic.

## Business Assumptions
We assume that the company wants an analysis of the dataset provided, but for this analysis to take place, the data must first be processed.

## Solution Strategy
For data cleaning and pre-processing, we use several data science techniques to handle null and categorical values.<br>
We chose the Python language and the Numpy library, due to their efficiency and speed.

## Next Steps
* Create a Business Report;
* Data Insights;
